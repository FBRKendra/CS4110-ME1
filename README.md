From what I've learned, Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950) is  one of the significant works in the field of Artificial Intelligence as it establishes the concept and the standard for what Artificial Intelligence truly is. The Turing Test or the Imitation Game was introduced in which we have a human being guessing which participant is human and which is the machine. If the human becomes confused between the two subjects, then that's when it passes the Turing Test as it successfully imitated the human behavior that a machine cannot normally do. This, in my opinion, really has changed the perspective of machinery in the 1900s and has brought new inventions, innovations, evolutions and developments that has brought us to a new age of technology to this day. It is because of Turing's works that we were able to evolve Artificial Intelligence and is now incorporated to several works which has provided comfort and efficiency to today's society.
